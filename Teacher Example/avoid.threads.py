"""
EV3 program to drive one direction but try to go around obstacles when bumped.
Author: Claude Sammut
Date: 1 April 2016

This program gets around the limitation of 'avoid.tidy.py', which can't handle
a new contact during the backup.

We introduce Python's threading mechanism. This is more complicated than using
exceptions, like in 'avoid.except.py' but allows us to separate handling of the
sensors from the motor control and gives us more flexibility.

Threads allow several pieces of code to run concurrently. We will run the motors
in a new thread whenever a new action is required. Because the motors are being
controlled in their own thread, the main program can keep looping, checking the
sensors. If the sensors indicate that a new action is required, we interrupt the
motor thread, let it die, and start a new thread for the new action.

An action can consist of a sequence of motor commands, e.g. avoiding an obstacle
includes a backup and a turn. An action sequence is represented by a list of
tuples (left_motor_speed, right_motor_speed, duration).
